## User Story

I'm Kai, a junior full stack web developer, and I defined myself more frontend than backend.
I'm currently looking for a job change, meanwhile I found that I should have a portfolio to showcase the skills I have, and demonstrate my projects and experiences.
In addition, I would like to have a place to summarise the knowledge I learned, as well as share my experience.

## Project plan
I plan to spread this project into 3 sprints, each sprint to achieve different features to make this continous.
Each sprint has 7 days, and hopefully finish this project in 1 months.

### Sprint 1
In this sprint, I'm going to implement basic functions with mock data.

### Sprint 2
In this sprint, I'm going to achieve the dashboard for management, and authentication.

### Sprint 3
In this sprint, I'm going to add blog, tweet functions, as well as testing.

### Future
Might integrate this project to TypeScript, with microservices implemented.
